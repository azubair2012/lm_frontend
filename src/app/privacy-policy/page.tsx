            <p>
              Your Personal Data isn’t just protected by the quality, commitment and high standards of London Move, it’s
              also protected by law. The law states that we can only process your Personal Data when there is a genuine
              reason to do so and it must be one of the following:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>To fulfil any contract that we have with you</li>
              <li>We have a legal obligation</li>
              <li>Where you have consented to the processing</li>
              <li>When it is in our legitimate interest</li>
              <li>When it is in the public interest</li>
              <li>When it is in your vital interests</li>

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.2em] text-[#111518]">Legitimate Interests</h2>
            <p>
              When we have a business or commercial reason to process your Personal Data this is referred to as a
              legitimate interest. Your Personal Data is still protected, and we must not process it in a way that would
              be unfair to you or your interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we do use legitimate interests as a reason to process your Personal Data we will tell you that we are
              doing so, what our legitimate interests are and provide you with a method to raise any questions or
              objections you may have. However, compelling grounds for processing such information may over-ride your
              right to object.

            <p>
              We currently use a system known as Winman (ERP Software); for the purposes of data protection law they act
              as a Data Processor on our behalf, and we act as a Data Controller. We collect personal data, enter it into
              Winman and we decide how to use it further. Winman processes this data solely under the instructions of our
              use and in accordance with their Terms &amp; Conditions (which are updated from time to time). Winman have
              implemented the following:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>To have a written agreement in place with their clients and suppliers</li>
              <li>To ensure their employees with access to our data are subject to a duty of confidence</li>
              <li>To ensure the security of processing activities</li>
              <li>To notify you of any sub-processing relevant to our business</li>
